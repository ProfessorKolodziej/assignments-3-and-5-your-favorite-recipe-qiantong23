	<p>Introducing my new favorite way to cook tofu: on the grill! This recipe will show you how to make tofu taste
		amazing using a simple marinade and a hot grill. Who knew it could be so easy?</p>
	<p>The blocks of tofu are sliced into wide and thick slabs and then dunked in a savory marinade made from 5 pantry
		staples. The tofu soaks in those wonderful flavors for a few hours before it’s fired on the grill. From the
		gorgeous grill marks to the classic barbecue flavors to the endless ways to enjoy them, these grilled tofu
		steaks
		are too good to pass up!</p>
	<h2>Why you’ll love this grilled tofu recipe</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Golden on the outside, meaty on the inside – The high heat gives the marinated tofu steaks irresistible
			golden
			grill marks on the outside while the inside stays tender and meaty.</li>
		<li>An easy summer protein – Make in advance and fire the pieces on the grill anytime you need an easy and
			delicious plant protein for your summer dinners.</li>
		<li>The easiest and most delicious marinade – Like my <a
				href="https://www.noracooks.com/marinated-tofu/">Marinated Tofu</a> recipe, I marinated the tofu slices
			in a
			5-ingredient marinade to give them rich and savory flavors.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How to grill tofu</h2>
	<p>Find the complete recipe with measurements in the recipe card below.</p>
	<p>Press the blocks of tofu for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the soy sauce, avocado oil, seasoned rice
		vinegar, sesame oil, and garlic powder together in a small bowl.</p>
	<p>Pro tip: Use extra firm or super firm tofu for this recipe! Softer varieties, like medium or soft tofu, will
		crumble and fall through the grill grates.</p>
	<p>Slice the tofu block into thick slices and place them in a large shallow dish or large ziplock bag. Pour the
		marinade over the tofu, then cover the dish or seal the bag and leave it to marinate in the fridge.</p>
	<p>Take the tofu slabs out of the marinade and place them on a preheated grill. Grill the tofu on both sides until
		golden brown grill marks appear. When done, transfer the grilled tofu steaks to a platter and cover them with
		aluminum foil to keep them warm.</p>
	<p>Before serving, simmer the reserved marinade in a saucepan until it thickens slightly, then pour it over the
		tofu.
		Enjoy!</p>
	<h3>Tofu sticking to grill?</h3>
	<p>There are a few tricks to get your tofu to release easily from the grill (or a grill pan).</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Use only extra-firm or even super-firm tofu. And press extra-firm tofu to get rid of excess water.
		</li>
		<li>Use oil on the grill, and in the marinade.</li>
		<li>Don’t attempt to move the tofu for several minutes, until marks form and it cooks long enough on one side.
			This helps it to release easily. Use a fork to slowly and carefully pop them off to release the tofu from
			the
			grill without tearing. Don’t roughly handle the tofu with tongs, or it may fall apart and rip.</li>

		<h2>Questions</h2>
		<aside class="question-section">
			<div class="question">
				<h3>Do I have to press the tofu?</h3>
				<p>Yes, pressing the water out of the tofu blocks is a crucial step. Pressed tofu not only has a firmer and
					meatier texture but also absorbs flavors more easily. To press the tofu, either use a tofu press or wrap
					each block in a few paper towels, place a plate or pan on top, and put a couple of heavy books on top of
					that. The only way to avoid pressing tofu is to use the super firm variety in a vacuum pack.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h3>How long should you marinate tofu?</h3>
				<p>I recommend marinating the tofu for at least 1 hour at room temperature or in the refrigerator overnight.
					The longer you marinate, the more flavorful they’ll be. Just don’t go over the 24-hour mark or else the
					tofu will start to crumble.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h3>How long does it take to grill tofu?</h3>
				<p>Depending on how thick you slice the tofu, each piece should need to cook for about 5 to 7 minutes per
					side on a medium-high heat grill. The tofu is grilled perfectly when you see golden brown grill marks.

				sesame oil</a></li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Press the tofu: Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu,
			and
			put a couple of heavy books on top of that. Let the tofu press for 30 minutes, or up to an hour.</li>
		<li>In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce, avocado oil, seasoned rice vinegar, sesame oil and garlic powder to
			combine.</li>
		<li>Slice the tofu into thick slices, about 4 slices per block of tofu. Place in a large shallow dish (or large
			ziplock type bag), then pour the marinade over the tofu.</li>
		<li>Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 1 hour, or even overnight. The longer you
			marinate, the more flavor. But I wouldn't go over 24 hours.</li>
		<li>Preheat an outdoor grill (or indoor grill pan) over medium-high heat and lightly oil. Remove the tofu from
			the
			marinade (but keep it nearby) and place on the hot grill. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side until
			golden
			brown marks appear. Turn with a metal spatula or fork, carefully loosening the tofu from the grate. Cook 5-7
			minutes on the other side, then transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.</li>
		<li>If desired, pour the reserved marinade into a saucepan and simmer for about 3 minutes. Pour as much as
			desired
			over the tofu for even more flavor and serve.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Use only extra-firm tofu that has been pressed well, OR the super firm variety (which does not need
			pressing).
		</li>
		<li>May use gluten free tamari for gluten free grilled tofu.</li>
		<li>Another vegetable oil works in place of avocado, like vegetable, canola or even olive oil.</li>
		<li>Leftover tofu keeps in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.</li>
